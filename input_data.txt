Question 1:  What data type would you use to store a person's age that will never be negative or have decimal points?
unsigned int
Question 2: Which data type is best suited for storing a single character value like 'A' or '$'?
char

bool
Question 4: If you need to store a very large whole number that could exceed 4 billion, which data type would you use?
unsigned long long
Question 5: For storing the exact price of an item (like $19.99) where precision is crucial and rounding errors must be avoided, what data type would be most appropriate?
double
